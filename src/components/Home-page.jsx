            <h3>Frontend Developer</h3>
            <p>I'm Luka, a frontend developer who believes code is both a craft and a conversation with the user.
                <br />
                I build interfaces with clarity, simplicity, and care — because great design should feel like a deep breath: smooth, intuitive, and easy to trust.
                <br />
                My goal? To create web experiences that resonate — not just function.
